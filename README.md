# LatentSpaceResponseModels
 Codebase for latent space response models with Professor Minjeong Jeon. 

Directories named "MCMC {Method}" should include generic template code for a particular method, and can be used to store output on a basic application dataset. When adapting this code to a dataset that requires alterations to the method that are not general enough to be included in the template file, the template should be copied into an appropriately named directory in "Test Runs". When updates to the template code are made they currently have to be translated manually to the application (test run) code directories that depend on them, but for the most part this seems to be more straightforward than making the template code exhaustively general.
