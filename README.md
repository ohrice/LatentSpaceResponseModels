The "MCMC Template" directory has generic code that supersedes all of the old Vanilla, Cluster, Paired Cluster, Ordinal, and Ordinal Cluster codebases. When adapting this code to a dataset that requires alterations to the method that are not general enough to be included in the template file, the template should be copied into an appropriately named directory in "Test Runs" (for example, Test_Runs/MCMC Cluster Spelling Gender Runs alters the prior Gaussian mixture structure to be on gender in the spelling dataset, which is not a general enough alteration to be included in the template code). When updates to the template code are made, they currently have to be translated manually to the 'test run' directories.
