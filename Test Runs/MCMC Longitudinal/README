Files:
init_{modelname}.R: function to initialize the sampler based on parameters from config_{config_number}.Rdat in the Run_configs diretory

make_config.R: makes a config file to be stored in the Run_configs directory

likelihood_functions.R: contains the marginal likelihood and prior functions for each parameter, as well as a joint likelihood  function

update_functions_{modelname}: provides functions for the sampler

mcmc_sampler_{modelname}: provides a function to run the MCMC sampler for a given 1. number of runs, 2. config file, 3. seed, and 4. dataset. You can also specify the frequency at which the output is plotted and stored. Samples are stored in Saved_output/saved_output_config_{config_number}_seed_{seed_number}_data_{dataset_name}.Rdat. Plots are stored in Images/plots_config_{config_number}_seed_{seed_number}_data_{dataset_name}/iteration_{iteration_number}.png

run_sampler_multiple.R: allows for the sampler to be run for a range of parameter configurations and random seeds

Model description directory: Contains a latex document describing the model
